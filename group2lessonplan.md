Arrow Functions

ES6 has introduced ARROW FUNCTIONS which have three main benefits. First, they have a concise syntax. Secondly, they have implicit returns, which allows us to write these nifty one-liners.

Thirdly, they don’t rebind the value of this when you use a arrow function inside of another function, which is really helpful for when you’re doing things like click handlers and whatnot.
